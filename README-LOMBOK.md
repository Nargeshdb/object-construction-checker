This document describes how to use this checker to avoid run-time exceptions resulting from failing
to set required fields in calls to builders generated by [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org).

What youâ€™ll need:
* A project that uses Lombok via the [io.freefair.lombok](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.freefair.lombok) Gradle plugin.
* [Todo: remove this requirement] Locally-built copies of the Typesafe Builder Checker and the Returns Receiver Checker, with their artifacts published to your local Maven repository

What to do:
Add the [org.checkerframework](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.checkerframework) Gradle plugin to your `plugins` block in your `build.gradle` script:

```groovy
plugins {
 	id "io.freefair.lombok" version "3.6.6"
	id "org.checkerframework" version "0.3.9"
}
```

Add a `checkerFramework` block that tells the plugin to run the Typesafe Builder Checker to your `build.gradle` script:

```groovy
checkerFramework {
 	checkers = ['org.checkerframework.checker.builder.TypesafeBuilderChecker']
}
```

Add a `checkerFramework` dependency on the Typesafe Builder Checker to your `dependencies` block (this is a compile-time only dependency):

```groovy
dependencies {
        checkerFramework 'org.checkerframework:typesafe-builder:0.1-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

Add an `implementation` dependency on the annotations used by the Typesafe Builder Checker (the checker needs to be able to place annotations in your code as it compiles, so the annotations must be on the compile classpath):

```groovy
dependencies {
	implementation 'org.checkerframework:typesafe-builder-qual:0.1-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

Once this is done, building your program will run the checker and alert you at compile-time if any required properties are not set.
